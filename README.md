# Custom CSS
This is a repository of custom CSS themes for websites I use often.

Each file name describes the theme and where it is intended to be used.

<code>css.css</code> files are human-readable.
<code>tag.txt</code> files are condensed and enclosed in a <code>style</code> tag.

## Themes Included
```
filename                intended URL            description

canvas-retro-theme      canvas.liberty.edu/*    green on black retro theme
```
## How to Use
I paste the CSS themes into the Chrome extensions <code>Custom CSS by Denis</code> or <code>User JavaScript and CSS</code> on my own device.

On other devices, the fastest way to preview the theme using Chrome is to navigate to the raw URL (<code>raw.githubusercontent.com/noahdacool/custom-css/master/canvas-retro-theme-tag.txt</code> for example), copy the content, open the page you wish to apply the theme to, open developer tools > elements, select the <code>head</code> tag and duplicate it, right-click the duplicated tag and select <code>Edit as HTML</code>, select all and paste.
